This is a collection of sampling strategies for (binary) configuration spaces. The algorithms implemented here are merely intended for demonstration and teaching purposes. A more mature tool box that has been widely used for configuration sampling is [SPLConqueror](https://github.com/se-sic/SPLConqueror).
