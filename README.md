# pycosa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smba/pycosa.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/smba/pycosa)
This is a collection of sampling strategies for (binary) configuration spaces. The algorithms implemented here are merely intended for demonstration and teaching purposes. `pycosa` is a pure Python implementation of recent sampling strategies and is built upon the `z3` wrapper for Python. The software is provided 'as is' and -- as much as the test cases -- are in an early stage. A more mature toolbox that has been widely used for configuration sampling in research is [SPLConqueror](https://github.com/se-sic/SPLConqueror)
