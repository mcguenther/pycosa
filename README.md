# pycosa [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smba/pycosa.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.org/smba/pycosa)
This is a collection of sampling strategies for (binary) configuration spaces. The algorithms implemented here are merely intended for demonstration and teaching purposes. A more mature tool box that has been widely used for configuration sampling is [SPLConqueror](https://github.com/se-sic/SPLConqueror).

##### Sampling with Diversity Promotion
To mitigate the inehrent bias when entirely relying on a solver to draw samples, mutation of the order of literals in clauses and clauses themselves can increase the variation between obtained samples. This approach implements the SATIBEA/diversity promotion approach (see below), which is an extension to the simple solver-based random sampling. The mutation steps significantly increase the overhead when sampling.

The class `pycosa.sampling.DiversityPromotionSampler` provides a method `sample` to draw a specified number of configurations.
