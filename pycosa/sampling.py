class CoverageSampler:
    '''
    This class implements sampling strategies with regard to main effects, such as 
    single features' or interactions' influences. This comprises both feature-wise, t-wise
    and negative-featurewise / negative-t-wise sampling.
    
    Brief summary of sampling strategies:
    
    Feature-wise sampling: 
    Activates one feature at a time while minimizing the total 
    number of set of activated features. This usually only activates the mandatory features 
    plus those implied by the one feature selected. The total number of configurations should be
    equal to the number of optional features.
    
    T-wise sampling: 
    Similarly to feature-wise sampling, this activates a combination of T features
    per configuration test for this interaction's influence. Again, the total number of selected features 
    is minimized, such that only implied and mandatory features are selected. The number of configurations cannot
    be greater than 'N over T', where N is the total number of features and T is the target interaction degree. 
    
    Negative feature-wise sampling: 
    Similar to feature-wise sampling with the exception that each optional feature
    is de-selected while the the total number of selected features is maximized. Here, we aim at identifying the 
    influence caused by the absence of individual features.
    
    Negative t-wise sampling: 
    Similar to t-wise sampling, but the combination of T features is de-selected and the total
    number of features is maximized. Here, we aim at identifying the influence caused by the absence 
    of a feature combination.

    '''
    This sampling technique aims at providing a diverse / more representative configuration sampling strategy
    by mitigating the bias introduced by using a constraint solver (cf. NaiveRandomSampler). For each configuration, 
    the sampling strategy shuffles both the order of the clauses in the feature model CNF as well as the order of
    literals in each clause (SATIBEA approach). While not very efficient, this results in dissimilar solutions
    and an overall more diverse configuration sample.
    
    NOTE: For efficient random sampling, it is preferable to use the DistanceSampler, this implementation
    should primarily serve for demonstration purposes!
