class CoverageSampler(Sampler):
    '''
    This class implements sampling strategies with regard to main effects, such as 
    single features' or interactions' influences. This comprises both feature-wise, t-wise
    and negative-featurewise / negative-t-wise sampling.
    
    Brief summary of sampling strategies:
    
    Feature-wise sampling: 
    Activates one feature at a time while minimizing the total 
    number of set of activated features. This usually only activates the mandatory features 
    plus those implied by the one feature selected. The total number of configurations should be
    equal to the number of optional features.
    
    T-wise sampling: 
    Similarly to feature-wise sampling, this activates a combination of T features
    per configuration test for this interaction's influence. Again, the total number of selected features 
    is minimized, such that only implied and mandatory features are selected. The number of configurations cannot
    be greater than 'N over T', where N is the total number of features and T is the target interaction degree. 
    
    Negative feature-wise sampling: 
    Similar to feature-wise sampling with the exception that each optional feature
    is de-selected while the the total number of selected features is maximized. Here, we aim at identifying the 
    influence caused by the absence of individual features.
    
    Negative t-wise sampling: 
    Similar to t-wise sampling, but the combination of T features is de-selected and the total
    number of features is maximized. Here, we aim at identifying the influence caused by the absence 
    of a feature combination.

class BDDSampler(Sampler):
    '''
    This class implements consistent uniform random sampling by partitioning the configuration space. The idea
    is to construct a binary decision diagram (BDD) for an existing feature model. Each distinct path in the BDD
    represents a partition of the confiuration space. For each path, for some, but not all configuration options values
    are assigned, leaving the un-assigned free to select from. By sampling across such partitions, one obtains a true
    random set of valid configurations.

    The construction of a BBD is time-consuming and does not scale well for large and complex feature models, however,
    this approach asserts randomness of the set of sampled configurations.
